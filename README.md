## About this project
This **minimal web-API**, written using ASP.Net Core, is a simple example of creating a query queue for executing some "heavy" process.
In the example, the workload is the calculation of the determinant of the matrix.

The project uses **Blazor WebAssembly** as a client and [NBomber](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/NBomber) as a load testing application.
